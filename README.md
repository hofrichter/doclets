# doclets
This example project (a result of my article in the JavaMagazin 12.15) describes the use of Javadoc's Doclet- and the Taglet-API. The pom.xml contains a profile, which can be used to compile the project and run the javadoc-generation in one step.
Just start it like this:
```
mvn clean install -P JavaMagazin
```
The tests are still not representative ;-)
